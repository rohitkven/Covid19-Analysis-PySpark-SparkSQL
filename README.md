# Covid19-Analysis-PySpark-SparkSQL
Analyzed COVID-19 data using PySpark and Spark SQL on an AWS EMR cluster, leveraging Docker for development


## Project Motivation 

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, and the United States is no exception. The goal of this project was to identify high-risk states for COVID-19 outbreaks and find potential solutions to reduce the risk. 

The motivation for analyzing high-risk areas is to identify potential interventions that can reduce the spread of the virus and protect individuals and communities. By analyzing mask usage in high-risk areas, researchers can gain insights into the effectiveness of public health messaging and interventions. The analysis of vaccination trends between different states is also important in identifying areas that may need additional resources or support to ensure that they receive the vaccine.

### Project Objectives:
- Identify high-risk states for COVID-19 outbreaks.
- Propose solutions to reduce the risk.
- Analyze mask-usage effects in high-risk areas.
- Examine vaccination trends between states.

## Data Source 

In our COVID-19 analysis project, we recognize the critical role of diverse datasets in navigating today's data-driven business landscape. Amid the pandemic, we leveraged datasets sourced from platforms like Kaggle and GitHub to address the pressing issues of mask usage and vaccine distribution.

We carefully selected data to ensure relevance, accuracy, and up-to-date information, providing us with a comprehensive dataset for our analysis.

## Results 


### Key Conclusions:
- Higher vaccination rates mitigate COVID-19 risk.
- Targeted interventions needed in highly populated states.
- Death percentages higher in areas with less mask usage.
- Mask mandates and compliance effective in reducing transmission.
- States with high mask-wearing likelihood also show higher vaccination rates.

### Implications and Recommendations:
- Emphasize vaccination campaigns to reduce pandemic impact.
- Target interventions in high-density areas for testing, tracing, and vaccination.
- Promote mask-wearing to reduce transmission and save lives.
- Highlight interconnectedness of individual behavior and public health outcomes.

### Overall Impact:
- Insights guide public health policy and future research.
- Emphasis on increasing vaccination rates and promoting mask-wearing for effective virus control.
